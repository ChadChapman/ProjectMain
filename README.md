What we implemented:
We have implemented email verification codes and verifiying users.  Also reseting the password.  We have current weather by device location, zip code, and by position on map.  Locations are savable and deletable.  We have list of new messages from various chats on our landing page.  You can navigate to the chat list fragment to see even more chats and to select one to post to.  You can leave a chat.  You can start a new chat and pick contacts to be in from anywhere in the main activity.  You can view/delete friends as well as accept/deny pending request and view/deleting sent contact requests.  You can search for a contact but it will only give you their first and last name.  You can change theme and text size.

What we did not implement:
We did not implement 24-hour or 5-day forcast.  We did not implement sending invitation email to phone contacts to join the app.  We did not implement notifications or SQLite internal storage.  Our search is a little lacking, it doesn't return a username which is what you need.  Ideally we should of been able to search and get a scollable list of result users and been able to select one so we could send a request but we ran out of time.  We also where a little disatisfied with the UI for our app, we could have made that a bigger priority.
