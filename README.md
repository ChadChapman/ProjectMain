# ProjectMain
## the "main" "for reals" "seriously' repo for the project, not a sandbox
### please read before using this repo

This repo is where our deliverable project lives.  

This should not be a sandbox or test repo for anyone, if you are looking to hone your git skills or get used to IDE & git integration features, please use either our group repo titled: "practice" or "ChadLab2".  
Lab uploads can be separate repos for each lab for each person, eg Lab3Chad, Lab3Igor, etc so we can all check out how the other members solved the lab problems and we can compare techniques without confusion.  We can make a bajillion repos so don't worry about that, better to keep things clean and tidy.

## NOBODY SHOULD BE WORKING ON THE MASTER BRANCH IN THIS REPO!!!

If you are working on the master branch, it is very possible for you to f#$k up this project for everyone!
If you aren't familiar with git branching, please ask, follow a git tutorial.
This git tutorial is great and really helped me : http://jlord.us/git-it/index.html

### It's a good idea to make a new branch for each sprint, each user story, whatever.

using the branching feature in git will help our code be more organized and it is just good practice, branches are cheap so let's use them!  Please try and name your branches with your name and whatever you are working on so everyone else can easily tell what is going on.  Branch names like "branch5" suck, they tell the team nothing.  Branch names like "Chad_login_frag_sprint1" 

Once you are at a point you want to merge your branch with the master branch, please submit a Pull Request (to pull your changes into the master branch) then make sure at least one other team member looks at your code before accepting the PR and merging your branch into the master branch.  After a merged PR, please rebuild and run the master branch to make sure all is still working.  If not, just let everyone know, rollback the changes and we can make sure we always have a working app to deliver.
