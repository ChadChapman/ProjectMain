we load and populate a list of contacts a number of times, we should maybe just have one stored somethere and
retrieve that ech time?  or just pass the same one around?s

ended with still needing to go: button -> create new chat (activity) -> get other user(s) memberID
or username -> begin new chat with that user -> load chatting fragment to allow it -> send a notification
to other user they have been invited -> invite takes them to the same chat frag (not same instance obv)
